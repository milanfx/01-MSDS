## C1 - What is Project Management?

### 01 - Project

- **Definition**: A temporary effort that creates value.
- **Examples**: Developing a new app, building a skyscraper, planning an event launch.
- **Characteristics**: Temporary in nature, sequence of activities, completed within a specific time and budget, fulfills customer/end-user needs.

### 02 - Management

- **Original Functions**: Planning, Organizing, Commanding, Coordinating, Controlling.
- **Modern Adaptation**: Commanding + Coordinating → Leadership.

### 03 - Functions of Management

- **Planning**: Set direction, define goals and results, establish methods, determine steps.
- **Organizing**: Combine resources (people, funding, equipment) to achieve goals.
- **Leadership**: Human aspect—hiring, training, coaching, reviewing performance, setting example.
- **Controlling**: Verify alignment with plan, schedule, and budget.

### 04 - Project Management

- **PMI Definition**: Application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to deliver value to people.
- **Project Manager Role**:
    - Apply tools, leadership, and management skills.
    - Solve business problems or act on opportunities.
    - Define tasks and develop detailed plans.
    - Manage resources (people, facilities, supplies).
    - Develop metrics to measure progress.
    - Communicate project status to stakeholders.

### 05 - Project Completion

- **Handover**: Deliver completed project to customer, client, or user.
- **Reflection**: Document lessons learned for use in future projects.

### Takeaway

- **Project**: Temporary effort with value creation, time and budget constraints.
- **Management**: Involves planning, organizing, leadership, and controlling.

## **C2 -** Characteristics of a Project

### 01 - Project Characteristics

- **Purpose**: Projects serve a purpose, meet a need, or create value for an organization.
- **Deliverables**: Projects create something with a result, either tangible (e.g., rocket booster) or intangible (e.g., software update, document).
- **Improvement**: Projects can improve an existing product or service.

### 02 - Unique Nature of Projects

- **Unique Objective**: Each project has a specific, one-time objective (e.g., developing a course in project management).
- **Temporary**: Projects have a defined start and finish; they end when objectives are met, funding runs out, or the project is no longer needed.
    - Distinction: Ongoing activities without an end date = **operations**.
    - Example: Designing and building an assembly line is a project; operating the line is ongoing operations.
- **Change Initiation**: Projects always initiate change, altering the status quo (e.g., hardware upgrade in an office).
- **Value Creation**: The most important characteristic of projects.
    - Example: Hardware upgrade → increased efficiency, reduced costs, improved data security, reduced risk of breaches.

### Takeaway

- **Projects vs. Operations**: Projects are unique and temporary; operations are ongoing and permanent.
- **Core Characteristics**: Unique, temporary, change-initiating, and value-creating.
- **Business Value**: Projects contribute efficiency, cost savings, security, or other benefits that support organizational success.

## C7 - Traditional, Agile, and Hybrid Methods

### 01 - Waterfall Project Management

- **Other Names**: Traditional Project Management, Predictive Project Management.
- **Approach**: Develop a full plan at the start and follow it throughout the life cycle.
- **Best Use**: When requirements are well known (e.g., building a house, bridge, airplane).
- **Process Flow**: Gather requirements → Design → Develop/Build → Test/Validate → Deploy.
- **Outcome**: One major “big bang” deliverable at the end.
- **Tools**: Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) with tasks, dependencies, and critical path.

### 02 - Agile Project Management

- **Origin**: Developed for software projects where requirements are uncertain.
- **Approach**: Collaborative and iterative with continuous customer involvement.
- **Best Use**: Innovative projects, evolving requirements, flexible environments.
- **Key Concept**: **Sprints** (timeboxed iterations, usually 1–4 weeks, consistent duration within a project).
- **Deliverables**: Incremental outputs at the end of each sprint, showcased to the customer.
- **Tools**: Backlog (prioritized requirements list), Sprint Backlog (selected tasks for sprint).
- **Scrum**: A specific Agile framework with defined roles and practices.

### 03 - Hybrid Project Management

- **Definition**: Combination of Waterfall and Agile tailored to organization, project, and team needs.
- **Application**:
    - Waterfall often used for **hardware/physical deliverables** where changes are costly.
    - Agile often used for **software/iterative deliverables** where changes are easier.
- **Flexibility**: May switch between methods across phases or run them in parallel (e.g., hardware with Waterfall, software with Agile).

### 04 - Comparison of Deliverables & Tools

- **Waterfall Deliverables**: One final, validated deliverable at the end.
- **Agile Deliverables**: Multiple incremental deliverables across sprints.
- **Waterfall Tools**: Work Breakdown Structure, dependencies, critical path analysis.
- **Agile Tools**: Backlog prioritization, sprint planning, sprint increments.

### Takeaway

- **Waterfall**: Best for projects with clear, stable requirements and expensive change costs; emphasizes upfront planning and one final deliverable.
- **Agile**: Best for projects with evolving requirements; emphasizes collaboration, sprints, incremental value delivery, and dedicated teams.
- **Hybrid**: Blends both methods; customized to project context, balancing predictability with flexibility.
